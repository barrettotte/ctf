# dead-drop

The Incident Response Team at Aurora Pharmaceuticals recently recovered this file from a user’s computer. 
The artifacts indicate it was accessed by what they believe to be multiple DEADFACE members. 
The program appears to have set up the user’s workstation as a dead drop for DEADFACE members to convert a 
secret numerical code into a password string for further target access. 
Our decoding attempts have been unsuccessful, but the script appears to contain a recovery code that may be a good starting point.

Submit the flag as flag{the password} exactly how print_password() returns it.

## Solution


The provided left_shift() function may help convert the password recovery string into a more useful string

`flag{the current plan is world domination}`
