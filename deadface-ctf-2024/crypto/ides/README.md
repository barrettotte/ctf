# Ides-le Talk 

We intercepted a file from one of DEADFACE’s more amateur members. 
They claim that they hid a password in a text file. 
When we looked at the file, it’s indecipherable jibberish. 
We believe a common cipher was used to hide the message (and the password). 
As far as possible keys goes, maybe it can be determined by the author of the original text?
