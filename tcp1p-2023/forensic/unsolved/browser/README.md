## Solution

The browser I used in this challenge is `Opera GX`, and you need to unlock the locked pastebin.com to obtain the flag

- You can find pastebin.com url inside History file
- And then you can find the password inside Web Data file inside autofill table
- Use that to open the pastebin and voila
