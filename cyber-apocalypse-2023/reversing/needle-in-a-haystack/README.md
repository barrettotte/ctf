**SOLVED**

> You've obtained an ancient alien Datasphere, containing categorized and sorted recordings of every word in the forgotten intergalactic common language. 
> Hidden within it is the password to a tomb, but the sphere has been worn with age and the search function no longer works, only playing random recordings. 
> You don't have time to search through every recording - can you crack it open and extract the answer?
