# reveal-mirveal

`mirveal` and `d34th` are known to use Twitter (errr.. X). 
Can you find a flag associated with mirveal on his social media?

Submit the flag as: flag{flag_goes_here}. Itâ€™ll be obvious when you find it.

NOTE: Please DM syyntax for sanity checks - DO NOT message random X accounts.

## Solution

Find d34th's twitter > find mirveal's tiwtter from d34th's following > find mirveal's mastodon from his bio > flag on mastodon

You can find d34th's twitter from past ctf writeups or using the hint on slothy (there's probably other ways)
