You find yourself in the middle of a deadly ancient maze. The maze sprawls before you, its secrets veiled in shadows, its gates locked tight against intruders. With thousands of keys shimmering under the harsh light, you steel yourself for the daunting challenge ahead. Each chamber of the maze presents a new puzzle to unravel, each gate a barrier to overcome. Armed with determination and resolve, you set forth into the labyrinth's depths, knowing that your survival hinges on unlocking the path forward by finding the proper key. With each new chamber you enter, you are greeted with a cup of teaâ€”a brief respite from the perilous journey that lies ahead. But the tea is not the only gift bestowed upon you in these chambers. With each cup, you receive a hint that will guide you on how to move on.
