# Steg Hide and Seek

Not much of a backstory here... there is an embedded flag in here somewhere, your job is to find it.

## Solution

you were supposed to use `stegseek` with a wordlist of the QR code values...

## Attempt

break up QR code mosaic into individual QR codes, then contrast colors so they can be read properly.

the data retrieved seems like junk... dont know what to do now
