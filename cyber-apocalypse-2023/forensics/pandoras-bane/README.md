# pandoras-bane

> Having now the relic, Pandora is trying to create a plan to shut down the vessels. 
> Unfortunately for her, the alien's intel is one step ahead, as they somehow know what she is up to. 
> An incident response operation started as Pandora was sure the aliens had gained access to her teammate's host. 
> Although many compromised hosts were found, only one sample is applicable for further analysis. 
> If you neutralize this threat by analyzing the sample, Pandora will be able to proceed with her plan.
