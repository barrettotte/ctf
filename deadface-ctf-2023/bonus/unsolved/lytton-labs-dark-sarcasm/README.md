or… Lytton Labs: How Can You Have Any Pudding If You Don't Eat Your Meat?

Lytton Labs is opening up a new Academy on Halloween, 2023. 
They had to abandon the old building after they kidnapped `TheZeal0t`, and he managed to escape from there. 
Dr. Geschichter, Stephanie W., and Dark Angel cleaned out any trace of their evil activities.

We have reason to believe that Lytton Labs is running a secret server that has information that could be of use in exposing their evil activities. 
Finding it is going to be a little tricky, because we believe that Lytton Labs is using advanced techniques to communicate the location of server to each other.

We know that DEADFACE has an interest in collecting information on Lytton Labs’ victims. 
We also know that `TheZeal0t` has particular interest in discovering what methods Lytton Labs used when they tried to recruit him.

We need you to help us find out actual name of “The Handler” that Lytton Labs used to try to initially recruit `TheZeal0t` (Daniel Sevold) into their fold back when he was in high school.

This mission will require some digging around Ghost Town and other challenges to locate their server and to get in to collect the information.

Enter the full name of “The Handler” in all caps, separated by spaces, like this: `flag{ALFRED JOSEPH HITCHCOCK}`.
