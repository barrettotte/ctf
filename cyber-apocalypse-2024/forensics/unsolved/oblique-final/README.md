# oblique-final

As the days for the final round of the game, draw near, rumors are beginning to spread that one faction in particular has rigged the final! In the meeting with your team, you discuss that if the game is indeed rigged, then there can be no victory here... Suddenly, one team player barged in carrying a Windows Laptop and said they found it in some back room in the game Architects' building just after the faction had left! As soon as you open it up it turns off due to a low battery! You explain to the rest of your team that the Legionnaires despise anything unethical and if you expose them and go to them with your evidence in hand, then you surely end up being their favorite up-and-coming faction. "Are you Ready To Run with the Wolves?!"
