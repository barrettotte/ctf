Lytton Labs hired a company to do a pentest on a portion of their internal environment. 
Long story short, they weren’t satisfied with the service, so they’ve turned to Turbo Tactical to figure out what happened during the pentest. 
All they know is that the pentesters leveraged a security protocol used to authenticate service requests between trusted hosts across the internet.

Turbo Tactical wants to replicate this during their pentest, but we want to know what kind of attack the pentesters leveraged.

Submit the attack type and the frame number of the attack as the flag: `flag{syn scan 1234}`.

Free Hint: It will not be something as generic as “Brute Force”.
