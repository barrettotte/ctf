There is a conspiracy theory called “Predictive Programming” that states that the Evil People in Charge (let’s call them “EPIC”) 
have made a deal with the Evil Boss (let’s call her “Lucy”) where they exchange their souls for power, fortune, and fame. 
However, the Good Boss (let’s call him “Josh”) doesn’t let the evil people just do whatever they want. 
Josh lets Lucy’s minions have some power, but they are required to warn their victims ahead of time of their nefarious plans.

Of course, Lucy thinks that’s just stupid. 
If she did that, no one would fall for them! So to get around the rule, Lucy and her EPIC acolytes communicate their evil 
plans to each other and to their unsuspecting victims through symbols (let’s call them “Sigils”). 
After all, it’s not THEIR fault if Mr. and Mrs. Johnny-Six-Pack don’t know what the symbol means, right? So they actively 
exploit the loophole in the contract.

There is a video that is being discussed on Ghost Town that appears to have such a hidden message.
