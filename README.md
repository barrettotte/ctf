# ctf

CTF notes and related junk.

Not quite writeups, but I'm sure there are snippets that would be helpful in future CTFs.

My goal is to participate in 1 or 2 CTFs per year.

### CTF Directory Structure

- `solved` - code for found flag
- `unsolved` - code for flags not found during CTF and reviewed/linked writeups
- `attempted` - flag wasn't found, but I thought there was some code worth keeping
