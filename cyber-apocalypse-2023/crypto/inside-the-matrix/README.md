> As you deciphered the Matrix, you discovered that the astronomy scientist had observed that certain stars were not real. 
> He had created two 5x5 matrices with values based on the time the stars were bright, but after some time, the stars stopped emitting light. 
> Nonetheless, he had managed to capture every matrix until then and created an algorithm that simulated their generation. 
> However, he could not understand what was hidden behind them as he was missing something. 
> He believed that if he could understand the stars, he would be able to locate the secret tombs where the relic was hidden.
