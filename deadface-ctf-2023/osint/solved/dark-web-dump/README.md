# dark-web-dump

Welcome to challenge 1 in the Track the Hacker Series, a multi-step challenge. 
You are simulating an attack path as the hacker to take over GlitterCo!

For this challenge, d34th dumped some data onto GhostTown in a thread about Dark Web Dumps. 
Use this information to track down the personâ€™s username and password that he left out on the public web! 
This will require a bit of social media and other websites to track these credentials down, think you can hack it?

Submit the flag as flag{username:password} (case sensitive).
