# compromised

An unknown individual gained unauthorized access to our old FTPS server. Moreover, the perpetrator somehow managed to acquire our private key beforehand. Could you determine the extent of information compromised by the perpetrator this time?

## Solution

Hint: It has been discovered that our private key was included among OpenSSL's compromised keys back in 2008. 
However, it might take a significant amount of time before you are able to find it.

Hint: If you're wondering about the PID seed, it should be around the 10,000th or higher.
