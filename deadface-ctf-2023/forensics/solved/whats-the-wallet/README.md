## Solution

```ps1
$encodedScript = @"
function Store-BtcWalletAddress {
    `$global:BtcWalletAddress = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes('bjMzaGE1bm96aXhlNnJyZzcxa2d3eWlubWt1c3gy'))
}

# Call the function to store the encoded Bitcoin wallet address
Store-BtcWalletAddress

# Access the stored encoded Bitcoin wallet address
Write-Host "Encoded Bitcoin Wallet Address: `$BtcWalletAddress"
"@
```

`bjMzaGE1bm96aXhlNnJyZzcxa2d3eWlubWt1c3gy` from base64 -> `n33ha5nozixe6rrg71kgwyinmkusx2`

`flag{n33ha5nozixe6rrg71kgwyinmkusx2}`
