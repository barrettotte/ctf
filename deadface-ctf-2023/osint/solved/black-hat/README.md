# black-hat

DEADFACE recently targeted David Rogers, a high-level executive at Cronin Group. 
We're trying to work the attack backwards to find out how they were able to determine he was at this year's Black Hat convention in Las Vegas, NV. We've determined that, at some point, a member of DEADFACE has physical contact with him and was able to plant a malicious USB in his pocket which he then used on his work computer. 
Figure out which event he participated in - this will help us narrow down attendees to see who might belong to DEADFACE.
