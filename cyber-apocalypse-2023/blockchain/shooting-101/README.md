receive() external payable — for empty calldata (and any value)
fallback() external payable — when no other function matches (not even the receive function). Optionally payable.

Function Modifiers are used to modify the behaviour of a function. For example to add a prerequisite to a function.

The function body is inserted where the special symbol "_;" appears in the definition of a modifier. So if condition of modifier is satisfied while calling this function, the function is executed and otherwise, an exception is thrown.

Declaring a state variable as public generates a public getter, but not a setter. If you want another contract to modify your contract's state variable, you'll have to write a function to do that yourself:

- 139.59.173.68:31303 <- rpc
- 139.59.173.68:31529 <- tcp
