# Right Time

TGRI employee Garry Sartoris fell for a phishing attack recently. Itâ€™s hard to say what DEADFACE was after, but Turbo Tactical 
needs your help looking through the attack artifacts. 
Take a look at this memory dump and submit the system time on which the memory was captured.

Submit the flag as flag{YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss+00:00}.
