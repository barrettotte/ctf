# gamertime-cheat-code

DEADFACE has created a game to help recruit new young members. 
Apparently there is a flag hidden in the binary that can only be accessed by entering a cheatcode that 
is used as a secret password before they allow these new recruits to join their ranks.

## Solution

some unity game, needs volume so probably going to do windows?

actually going to download on windows?
