# gloater

One thing that the overlords at KORPâ„¢ know best is the sheer sadistic value of taunting opponents. Throughout The Fray, onlookers can eagerly taunt and deride the contestants, pushing them mentally and breaking their will. By the end of the psychological torture, little of what was once human remains. You have come across a Gloater, one of the devices left around the Arena of The Fray. Gloaters allow you to send sardonic messages to the others, even taking on the shapes of their loved ones as the words cut deep into their psyche. But there's another well-known effect of such a weapon - the user of the Gloater puts a target on his back, as contestants from all factions swear to destroy the one who uses it.
