# permuted

You drop to the ground as a voltaic mist of energy surrounds you; within it are the Aranaya, reflections of your emotions that break into the physical world from the spiritual realm. Love, hate, pain and more writhe and dance before your eyes in an endless storm. As one tears into your soul, a lightning bolt strikes your inner being and the emotion remoulds into another. Startled and wide-eyed, you recognise an undeniable truth: they are all reflections of one another, an ecosystem of your being that you could lose forever. Consciousness leaves you as the psychedelic show whirls on. To retain your self, you must brave the storm: a cyclone of patterns, an infinitude of permutations.
