> As you hold the relic in your hands, it prompts you to input a coordinate. 
> The ancient scriptures you uncovered near the pharaoh's tomb reveal that the artifact is capable of transmitting the locations of vessels. 
> The initial coordinate must be within proximity of the vessels, and an algorithm will then calculate their precise locations for transmission. 
> However, you soon discover that the coordinates transmitted are not correct, and are encrypted using advanced alien techniques to prevent unauthorized access. 
> It becomes clear that the true coordinates are hidden, serving only to authenticate those with knowledge of the artifact's secrets. 
> Can you decipher this alien encryption and uncover the genuine coordinates to locate the vessels and destroy them?
