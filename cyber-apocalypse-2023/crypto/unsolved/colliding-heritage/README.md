> As you arrive at the location of the relic, you discover an ancient tomb that appears to have no visible entrance. 
> However, a scan of the area reveals the presence of unusual RF signals coming from a specific location. 
> With the help of your team, you manage to create an interface to communicate with the signal-emitting device. 
> Unfortunately, the device only grants access to descendants of the pharaoh's left hand. 
> Can you find a way to enter the tomb?
