In the eerie stillness of the Bitting village, a dilapidated laboratory lies forgotten and forsaken, its ancient walls whispering secrets of unspeakable horrors. As you awaken within its confines, a shiver runs down your spine, the air thick with the weight of untold darkness. With no recollection of how you came to be here, you begin to explore the place. The dim glow of flickering lights casts long shadows across the worn floors, revealing rusted equipment and decaying machinery. The air is heavy with the scent of decay and abandonment, a tangible reminder of the atrocities that once transpired within these walls. Soon, you uncover the sinister truth lurking within the laboratory's forgotten depths. This place was a chamber of horrors, a breeding ground for abominable experiments in human cloning. The realization sends chills coursing through your veins, your mind reeling at the thought of the atrocities committed in the name of science. But there is no time to dwell on the horrors of the past, because a sinister countdown echoes through the laboratory, its ominous tones a harbinger of impending doom. Racing against the ticking clock, you discover the source of the impending catastropheâ€”a chemical reactor primed to unleash devastation upon the village. With the weight of the world upon your shoulders, you realize that you alone possess the knowledge to defuse the deadly device. As a chemist, you understand the delicate balance of chemical reactions, and you know that triggering a specific collision multiple times is the key to averting disaster. With steady hands and a racing heart, you get to work. As the seconds tick away, you feel the weight of the world bearing down upon you, but you refuse to falter.
