   [*] The path ahead is treacherous.                                         ☠️
☠️  [*] You have to find a viable strategy to get everyone across safely.      ☠️
☠️  [*] The bridge can hold a maximum of two persons.                          ☠️
☠️  [*] The chasm lurks on either side of the bridge waiting for those         ☠️
☠️      who think they can get across in total darkness.                       ☠️
☠️  [*] If two persons get across, one must come back with the flashlight.     ☠️
☠️  [*] The flashlight has energy only for a limited amount of time.           ☠️
☠️  [*] The time required for two persons to cross, is dictated by the slower. ☠️
☠️  [*] The answer must be given in crossing and returning pairs. For example, ☠️
☠️      [1,2],[2],... . This means that persons 1 and 2 cross and 2 gets back  ☠️
☠️       with the flashlight so others can cross.
