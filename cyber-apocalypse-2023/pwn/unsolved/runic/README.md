# runic

> Pandora is close to finally arriving at the Pharaoh's tomb and finding the ancient relic, but she faces a tremendously complex challenge. 
> She stumbles upon a alien-looking piece of technology that has never been mentioned in her archives, and it seems to be blocking the entrance to the Pharaoh's tomb. 
> The machine has some runes inscribed on its surface, but Pandora can't work their meaning out. 
> The only thing she knows is that they seem to appear, change and disappear when she tries to manipulate them. 
> She really can't figure out the inner workings of the device, but she can't just give up. Can you help Pandora master the runes?
