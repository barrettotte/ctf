Legend tells of an English family who moved to Connecticut in the 1700s only to be stricken with grief and ultimately death. 
A common place for ghost hunters and thrill seekers, this haunted location is one I have been to many times. 
Can you tell me what year the General’s wife was killed and how?

 His ship reached Plymouth on December 19, and Cornwallis arrived in London on December 23. Apparently without discussing the matter with the secretary of state for American colonies, Goerge Germain, or the king, Cornwallis turned in his RESIgnation from the army. King George, probably sympathizing with him during the grave illness of Jemima, accepted the RESIgnation. Cornwallis then left London and hurried to his Suffolk estate and the bedside of his wife, whom he found, as he siad, in "a very weak state indeed," suffering apparently from a liver disease.

DudleyTown ?

```txt
Another bizarre tragedy affected one of the most famous residents of the region, General Herman Swift, 
who had served in the Revolutionary War under George Washington. 
In 1804, his wife, Sarah Faye, was struck by lightning while standing on the front porch of their home near Dudleytown. 
She was killed instantly. The General went insane and died soon after. 
Many have dismissed this incident as not being connected to the other unusual events, saying that Swift did not 
actually live in Dudleytown but on Bald Mountain Road (where his house remains today) and that he only went insane when he became old and senile. 
But in an area this sparsely populated, the records indicated three people to have gone insane in the space of less than a half century – could 
this be mere coincidence? And does a person being struck by lightning while standing on their front porch qualify as being "unusual"? 
I would say that it does and our story is not yet complete.
