# control-room

> After unearthing the crashed alien spacecraft you have hacked your way into it's interior. 
> Nothing seems perticularily interesting until you find the spacecraft's control room. 
> Filled with monitors, buttons and panels this room surely contains a lot of important information, including the coordinates of the underground alien vessels that you 've been looking for. 
> You decide to start off by booting up the main computer. 
> You hear an uncanny buzzing-like noise and then a monitor lights up requesting you to enter a username. Can you take control of the Control Room?
