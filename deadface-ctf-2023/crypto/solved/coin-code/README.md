# coin-code

We found this image of a coin that belongs to a member of DEADFACE. 
The image has something to do with the encoded message. 
We believe the message indicates who this DEADFACE actor wants to target next. 
Figure out who the target is.

Submit the flag as flag{Target Name} (e.g., flag{Bob's Auto})

The encoded message reads: Fwpl lsjywl xgj ew oadd tw Smjgjs Hzsjes.
