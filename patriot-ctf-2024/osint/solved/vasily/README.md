# Vasily

We have been tracking a highly suspicious submarine believed to be harboring many enemy skiddies. 
Unfortunately, this satellite image is rather out of date. 
Your mission is to locate the submarines there using a more up-to-date image, and tell us what class they are with their NATO reporting name - a letter from the NATO phonetic alphabet, spelled out.

We want to know precisely where the aft (rear or backend) end of northernmost submarine attached to the pier is. 
Communicate its location in three words. 
Include the NATO reporting name of the class of submarine in your answer.

Submission format: PCTF{three.position.words.class_name} Example submission: PCTF{employing.broken.imports.sierra}

Per common feedback for “Give me four words, Vasily”: Make sure you use the official site. That’s all I’ll say
