# ham-jam

It seems as if there is an upcoming hack that the rest of DEADFACE is planning, but someone didn't seem to get the memo. 
So, instead of risking meeting up to share the date, one of them has used a ham radio to send a message we managed to intercept.

We also identified some chatter associated with the coded message, but we have not been able to figure it out. 
Itâ€™s possible there might be clues left on their message board?

Submit the flag as flag{Month-Day#}. Example: flag{DECEMBER-10}.
