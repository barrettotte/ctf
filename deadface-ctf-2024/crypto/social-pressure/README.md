Hey lilith, big news! We're going after De Monne Financial next. Their security measures have some holes that we're gonna exploit big time! I've been poking around and found some SQL vulnerabilities we can leverage for maximum chaos.

Remember that IT guy I mentioned before? Turns out, he’s a real chatty Cathy on social media. Think we can use some good ol' social engineering to our advantage. We’ll get him spewing passwords like a leaky faucet. Plus, with your OSINT skills and my SQL magic, they won’t see what hit 'em.

I've already started some OSINT recon and guess what? Found some juicy deets about their IT team on LinkedIn. People overshare so much, it's practically a goldmine. Social engineering that chatty dude should be a breeze; I'll craft a legend that'll have him spilling everything.

Yaaas, this is gonna be legendary! Loving the enthusiasm. And Elroy Ongaro? That guy's practically rolling out the red carpet for us with how much he shares online. Can't believe how easy some of these targets make it.

Absolutely! Elroy Ongaro has no idea what's coming his way. I've already got a few angles in mind to get him talking. Social engineering these types is always a thrill.

I'll start drafting some personas and scripts. Once he's under our influence, we can orchestrate the SQL exploit seamlessly. Your expertise in that area is going to be crucial.
