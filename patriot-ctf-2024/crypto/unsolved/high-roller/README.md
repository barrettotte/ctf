# High Roller

We recieved word that a criminal APT had developed their own method for generating secure asymmetric encryption keys. 
We were able to intercept emails between the group including encrypted comms, and a 7zip file. 
All we managed to find in the 7zip file they sent out was their public key, and the key generator. 
Can you decrypt the comms?

pycryptodome v3.20.0
