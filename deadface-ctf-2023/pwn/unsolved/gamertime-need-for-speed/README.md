DEADFACE has created a game to help recruit new young members. 
Apparently there is a flag returned by a game server when you reach the flag at the end of the level. 
This is used to see which new, young recruits are true gamers. 
Can you find the flag?

## Solution

edit and recompile the `Assembly-CSharp.dll` and comment the damage out, and then you can walk to the flag
