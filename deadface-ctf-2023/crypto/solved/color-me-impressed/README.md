# color-me-impressed

There have been some encrypted documents being passed around on the Ghost Town forum. 
When asked for the password, someone just posted a link to some web color template tool. 
We don't know what to make of this. Do you?

Submit the flag as flag{flag_text}.

## Solution

https://ghosttown.deadface.io/t/chickens-cant-fly-but-these-ones-do-a-lot/128

is it just hex colors in a row?

- 476C40
- 353548
- 237524
- 332474
- 4F6E33
- 536D40
- 35680A

`476C403535482375243324744F6E33536D4035680A` -> from hex

password: `Gl@55H#u$3$tOn3Sm@5h`

open `flights.zip` with password

flag at bottom of json

`flag{D3@dF@c3Rulz!}`
