# Turbo Tactical

The team at Turbo Tactical wants to try to infiltrate you into DEADFACE as a programmer. 
Thing is, DEADFACE is picky about who they bring in, so Turbo Tactical wants to make sure you're the real deal when it comes to programming.

To prove yourself, write a program that will enumerate a list of numbers 1-500. 
For each number divisible by 3, replace it with TURBO. 
For each number divisible by 7, replace it with TACTICAL. 
For numbers divisible by both 3 and 7, replace it with TURBOTACTICAL. 
Feed this data into the server listed below and the flag will be revealed.

Example input: [1, 2, "TURBO", ...]

147.182.225.243:33000

Submit the flag as flag{flag_text}.
