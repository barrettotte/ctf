How could we have missed this?? 
There were TWO word searches stuck together that the DEADFACE courier dropped. 
We’ve already solved the first one, but maybe solving this second word search will help us uncover the secret message they’re trying to covertly relay to the other members of DEADFACE. 
Hopefully, THIS will tell us how they plan to execute their next move.

Submit the flag as flag{TARGETNAME} (e.g., flag{THISISTHEANSWER})
