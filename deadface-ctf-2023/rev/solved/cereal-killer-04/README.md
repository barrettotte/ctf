# cereal-killer-04

lilith is not too old to have a favorite monster / ghoul / daemon / phantasm / poltergeist / creature / extraterrestrial or a favorite sugary breakfast cereal! She also has a favorite programming language (which no one else at DEADFACE likes that much, and they all think she is kinda weird for it). She probably mainly likes it because it was her first language she learned at the age of 9.

See if you can crack her program and figure out what her favorite cereal and entity are.
